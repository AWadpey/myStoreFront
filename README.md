# myStoreFront

An Amazon-like storefront that runs in your terminal built with mySQL and NODE.js. The user is prompted to pick a product by its ID and the quantity they desire to purchase. If the supply meets the demand the purchase will execute, the stock quantity will deplete, and the total cost of the transaction will be calculated.

# Directions

1. clone repo
2. npm intall
3. cd myStoreFront
4. node bamazonCustomer.js
